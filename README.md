#### Dependancies

---
```
install.packages("R2WinBUGS")
install.packages("arms")
```


## Download and install Winbugs 

Winbugs will need to be extracted into the program files of your computer. [More info here](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/)



## Download and install the mixFish package.

<br>

This must be done through locally installing the mixFish package to your computer. Then, upload the package into R through Tools --> install packages --> local zip file. The file must be zipped when loaded into R. 

<br>

[mixFish](https://dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/documents/aah-saa/otoliths/statistical/mixFish_1.03.zip) will not work in R 4.0. So you may need to install an [older](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.5.1/) version of R.
